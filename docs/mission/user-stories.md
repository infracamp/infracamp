# Methods developing products from ideas

Developing products is a difficult task. Not because the technology
is complex. The main task is to understand your users/customers and
determine their needs exactly.

Along the [KISS Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) we want to develop
ony features, we or our clients really need. Why do we need to focus on KISS?

- The customer wants an easy to use product.

- Manuals are bad: Your Product must explain itself without the need for any
  documentation for basic usage.

- Development should focus on demands instead of selling. Selling is important, too.
  But focus of development should be to meet your customers demands in the first place.
  
- You can't develop unless you know your user: Programming is formalized knowledge.
  You need a very detailed understanding of your customers tasks and needs to develop
  customer centric software. All software you write in advance will miss these needs,
  because you start selling your features instead of listening to your customers demands.
  
## User Stories

If we want to develop real customer centric solutions, we need a scheme to develop, discuss
and document the needs of our customers.

Therefore we need to know:

- Know the stakeholder:
    
    - Who is using our system
    
    - What does his daily work look like
    
    - What are his goals
    
    - What does he struggle with => Where can we help him with his daily tasks.

- Know the Business
   
    - How are decisions made today
    
    - Who decides what
    
    - Who spends time to what
    
The most important thing to accomplish this task is to understand sales.
