## Why should enterprises develop open-source software

- Open-source prevent your developers from reinventing the wheel.

- Your personnel can use and engage in your projects in their spare time and after
  leaving your company.
  
- It's better even for competing companies to have their developers work together.
  
  
## Why enterprises can't to open-source software on their own

- It's not only about the license. You'll need development resources (github, giblab), build and
  testing resources, marketing, etc. These need owners to coordinate develompent, approval of
  pull-requests and have full resource access.
  
- Competing enterprises won't allow development on projects their competitor established as long
  as the copetitior gains all credits from it and has can withdraw the project with a single management
  decision. 
  
- No developer will publish great work if he/she won't take credit for it.

## What infracamp provides

  Projects as github/gitglab/bitbucket owner.

## FAQ

**Why does an enterprise need a third-party organisation to maintain open-source projects?**

The question is the reason you want to develop open-source software. If you want to benefit
from other developers and enterprises to join your development approach, no enterprise can be
owner of the project.

Somebody must be owner of the repository, server resources etc. No community will build up
around a project that might be just dropped by the owner.
