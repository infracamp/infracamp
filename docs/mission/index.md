## Why should enterprises develop open-source software

- Open-source prevent your developers from reinventing the wheel.

- Your personnel can use and engage in your projects in their spare time and after
  leaving your company.
  
- It's better even for competing companies to have their developers work together.
  
  
## Why enterprises can't do open-source software on their own

- It's not only about the license. You'll need development resources (github, giblab), build- and
  testing resources, marketing. Maintainers must be found to coordinate development, approval of
  pull-requests and for full resource access.
  
- Enterprises won't allow development on projects their competitors gain all credits for.
  In particular because it might be withdrawed with a single management decision if its owned
  and financed by a company.
  
- No developer will publish great work if he/she won't take credit for it.

## FAQ

**Software is no competitive edge - skills are.**

The difficulty in software is to master a task the first time. After you showed the world that it 
can be done, it will be done faster and better by your competitors. The competitive advantage enterprises
really have is the skillset of their personnel. These skills must be kept up to date.

To keep developer skills up to date developers need feedback and discussion with other developers.
Open-Source is a concept to motivate developers improving their skills and writing software
that need not to hide from the community.

**Why does an enterprise need a third-party organisation to maintain open-source projects?**

Excellent software is developed by ambitious individuals, not by enterprises. Ambitious developers 
invest brain and hard work into software, so they should take personal credit for their work in the
developer community.

Enterprises exist to sell products. They can't take care for community concerns, discuss rules
for cooperation and they won't promote products they can't sell.
