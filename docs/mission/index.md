# Our mission

***We are developers. We are independent businesses, sharing the development of our
foundations.***

Developing and maintaining highly scalable infrastructure services is 
a difficult and expensive but vital task for modern organisations. Infracamp's mission
is to provide professional exchange and collaboration on developing 
lean development-oriented services and expertise from private companies to
everyone.

We believe concepts and architecture are way more important than programming-language
and platforms. To prevent chaos, infracamp provides preconfigured best-practice 
container-setups suitable for our needs. 

Our backers provide the manpower to develop open-source infrastructure services
properly designed to the needs of our businesses.

## Target group

We can't provide frameworks for everyone's needs! We focus on:

- (Micro-)Webservices powered by script-languages as Python, PHP, Ruby, JavaScript, etc.
- container landscape (docker)
- HTTP based APIs
- massive hardware-scalability (1 - >100k CPU Cores)
- scalable agile team setups (including newbies)
- continuous deployment / fail fast
- code b4 configuration

Our belief: Secretiveness won't lead to success; collaboration and
know-how transfer does.

## Mission-statement

Imfracamp is an organisation to let your employees become developers.

- Infracamp is
    - Language-agnostic: We have containers for Python, PHP, NodeJS, Jekyll
      Develop your own, if you want to.
    - OS-agnostic: Supports Linux, MacOS and Windows
    - Platform-agnostic: AWS, GCS, Azure, Bare-Metal
    - Framework-agnostic: It's your turn
    - Open-Source-agnostic: MIT-licenced (Closed source if you want to)

We want to
- Collect best practice of companies doing webservices
- Provide foundation-services for scalable companies and organisations
     

Infracamp's goals:

- Supported by companies, powered by developers. 
- Vendor-agnostic: Infrastructure services run on Amazon, Google, Azure, any other hoster, 
  even Bare-Metal
- Shiftable: Google is billing you too much? Your Amazon free tier is over. Azure
  is too slow? We want to benefit from the best cloud-services available. And
  want to shift to better ones, as they come. Supported by infracamp's abstraction
  libraries
- Developer-centric: Developers should use their private github/gitlab accounts so their
  ideas count for their CV too.
- There is only better: We want to discuss and try different approaches. In development
  there is no right way. There is only a better way.
- Teachable: 
    - Small footprint.
    - Separate usability.
    - A small, non redundant and meaningful documentation is the most difficult task
        - For professionals
        - And for students


## Why do companies join infracamp?

Even if you have the best concept on doing one thing - you might miss another. Infracamp's
main effort is boosting the exchange between developers and their ideas. We want to provide
a friendly and open community to discuss and try out controversial concepts.

It's your employees ideas. And they can (hopefully will) contribute to it, even if they leave
your company. It might sound wired, but this is the only way to keep the knowledge of a leaving
colleague inside your company: Mainly because you'll won't find a developer maintaining some other ones ideas.

Furthermore: Infracamp is independent, so developers might be engaged to provide 
their spare-work projects. These projects might power your business for years.

Because all infracamp's projects are MIT licenced, you can make a copy and maintain the work
done on your own. (Feel free to do so with any of our projects - you'll miss all the further work done)

## Why do developers engage in infracamp? 

It's your project. Not your's companies one. Even if you change your company or get
self-employed: you'll keep your personal work and benefit from your and the work done of other contributors.

List contributions in your CV or hold a talk about it in a conference. It's yours. It's MIT licenced. 

Infracamp empowers you to:

- engage in public events (like conferences, etc.)
- disclose features in public events

as long they won't compromise your employers interests (as told to you - see [regularities](regularities.html)).

## Ideology

- No Frontend for internals: UI development is painful and slows the
  whole company down: The only UI for us is the IDE
- All configuration is version-controlled
- All communication is accessible
- Focus on technology not platforms: We don't want to teach platforms like jombla or
  typo3 (knowledge that might be useless in a few month). We teach long lasting technology like 
  HTML, CSS with a little bit of Jekyll.
- Beginners need real-world projects. Therefor we need a secured environment to
  stop poor programming skills from compromising our whole system.
- 95% Frameworks is enough: We want intuitive frameworks that help us in our daily work instead of
  providing an complex api to cover 99%.
- Home-Grown frameworks: We collect our know how in libraries so others don't have to know
  what we know,... now.
- Fail fast: Having a minimalistic application today is the goal. Because the perfect app will
  be dropped after the world ends.
- Less credentials: 
    - No credentials in repositories
    - Automatic rotation of application credentials
    - Encrypted credentials in repositories where needed
- Develop on your workstation
- Test on your workstation
- Automate everything you did more than twice
- Don't try to optimize server-resource usage (e.g. against waiting time) before you have a resource problem.
- Minimize waiting time whenever possible
