# Mission <small>Improving development performance by know how transfer</small>

Software-quality largely depends on programming skills combined with the underlaying infrastructure.
This infrastructure is often mission-critical and should be safeguarded from single individual actions,
bad judgement or commercial/political interest. 

<div class="alert alert-info">
Infracamp supports development of open-source frameworks and keeps them publicly available;
unaffected by political interests of single companies or individuals.

## Why should enterprises engage in open-source framework development

- Open-source prevent developers from reinventing the wheel.
  
- It's better even for competing companies to have their developers work together.

- Published Open-Source software is cleaner and better documented. Many dangerous quick-n-dirty solutions found
  in private repositories can't be done in open-source environments at all. Secure open-source
  measures will most probably have positive backlash to internal projects.
  
- Effords in writing community grade documentation will improve internal documentation as well.

- Lots of developers program as a hobby, too. Why not let them have and eventually improve the same infrastructure.

- Developers might not want to stay their whole life in one company. Open-Source can help
  to stay in touch and benefit from new experiences in exotic projects.
  
## Why enterprises can't do open-source frameworks on their own

- It's not only about the license. You'll need development resources (github, giblab), build- and
  testing resources, marketing. Maintainers must be found to coordinate development, approval of
  pull-requests and for full resource access.
  
- Enterprises won't allow development on projects their competitors gain all credits for.
  In particular because it might be withdrawed with a single management decision if its owned
  and financed by a company.
  
- Developers won't attempt to publish great work if they don't take credit for it.



## What infracamp provides

- Infracamp provides an administrational Team of elected Maintainers. This team maintains
  Projects as github/gitglab/bitbucket owner.
  
- We provide server resources and maintenance for background webservices.


## FAQ

**Software is no competitive edge - skills are.**

The difficulty in software is to master a task the first time. After you showed the world that it 
can be done, it will be done faster and better by your competitors. The competitive advantage enterprises
really have is the skillset of their personnel. These skills must be kept up to date.

To keep developer skills up to date developers need feedback and discussion with other developers.
Participating in Open-Source is the best way for developers to improve skills and write software
that need not to hide from the community.

**Why does an enterprise need a third-party organisation to maintain open-source projects?**

Excellent software is developed by ambitious individuals, not by enterprises. Ambitious developers 
invest brain and hard work into software, so they should take personal credit for their work in the
developer community.

Enterprises exist to sell products. They can't take care for community concerns, discuss rules
for cooperation and they won't promote products they can't sell.
