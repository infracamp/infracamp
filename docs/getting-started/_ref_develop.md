# Container-based Software Development Kits

By using *containers* not only for deployment but *also for development*, there is no need
to install libraries on your workstation. Nor do you have to care about version
conflicts, environments, paths, etc.

No more buggy project setup documentation. <kbd>git clone</kbd> the project and run <kbd>./kickstart.sh</kbd>.
Everything else is done 


## Clone and start your first project

Change to your Projects-directory <kbd>cd ~/Projects</kbd> and clone infracamp's demo project: 
<kbd>git clone https://github.com/infracamp/kickstart-demo.git</kbd>. Change to the demo project directory
<kbd>cd kickstart-demo</kbd> and run <kbd>./kickstart.sh</kbd>.

After the container was downloaded and startet, you'll see the bash prompt inside the container. You
can use `git`, `ssh`, `bash history` like you do in your local shell. The project-directory is mounted
to `/opt` inside the container:

Open `http://localhost:4300` in your browser. 

What happend?

- <kbd>kickstart.sh</kbd> evaluated the container configuration file <kbd>.kick.yml</kbd>
  and runs the container `infracamp/kickstart-flavor-gaia` specified in the `from` section.
  The container is running in **development-mode**: debugger, and other developer stuff is enabled.
  
- The current project directory is mounted to `/opt` directory inside the container and
  user rights are adjusted to your local user rights. Environment variables are adjusted.
  
- Inside the container, the starter script <kbd>kick</kbd> evaluates `.kick.yml` and runs the
  commands to install required stuff and setup the container. 
  
- To exit the container just type <kbd>exit</kbd>.
